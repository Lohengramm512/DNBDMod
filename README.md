Darkest Night, Brightest Dawn Mod

Phase 1 of this mod seeks to enable more team compositions by bringing less useful skills more in line with the better ones. This work is
laregly finished and will be the main thrust of the initial release.

Phase 2 will be Trinket adjustments, with the goal of removing all the negatives associated with -most- trinkets. Only extremely powerful
trinkets will still have negative traits associated with them for balance reasons.

Phase 3 will be adjusting Camping skills to be less of an extreme mix of just plain awful to amazing. Like the combat skill pass, the
focus will be more on bringing useless skills in line with the already good ones.

Phase 4 will be about adjusting monsters to continue to provide a fair challenge after all the player buffs that the mod has introduced.
It is possible some monsters may get nerfs, but I predict it will mostly be about buffing them slightly.

Phase 5 will be all about addressing the overall game flow, reducing grind, etc... Assuming RedHook hasn't taken steps themselves by
the time I get to this. They've indicated they are watching this closely and about to take more action.
